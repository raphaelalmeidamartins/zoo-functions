## :page_with_curl: About

JavaScript project developed by me ([Raphael Martins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelameidamartins/)) at the end of the Unit 8 Module 1 of the [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com)'s Web Development course. I was approved with 100% of the mandatory and optional requirements met.

We had to solve programming logic, and object/array manipulation challenges by using ES6 features such as **HOFs**, **arrow functions**, **array/object destructuring**, **spread operator**, **rest parameter** and more.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Tools
